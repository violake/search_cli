## SearchCli Class
#
#  Aim: Create a CLI framework
#
#  Design: a search cli that has help and quit command can also run command by given block
#
#  Concern: made an assumption for 'Enter' to continue as `Enter` is kind of difficult to handle
#           in current structure
#           so add 'next' to start a new search
#
